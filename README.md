# description
A website that will provide learning modules for sign language to people of all ages, including sign recognition that will generate text according to the signs recognized. We have added 3 learning modules, 1 quiz and 1 puzzle. We have also added a resource page to the website from which people can visit the official website and important YouTube links.
# tech stack used
To create the website, we have used: HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
# installation steps
1. Copy the URL of our repository "ByteVerse_RookieRevolutioners": https://github.com/Suhana-Singh/ByteVerse_RookieRevolutioners.git
2. Open VS Code, select "Clone git repository" and copy the URL to the bar.
3. Code will be then available on VS Code to be run on web browser.
# libraries and dependencies required for the project
Our website is designed to be lightweight and efficient, without relying on external libraries or dependencies.
# future scopes
At present, we have focused our efforts on developing the frontend of our website to ensure a seamless user experience. Our future roadmap includes expanding our capabilities to the backend using Node.js, as well as integrating APIs to enable sign language recognition and text generation functionalities. Due to our current resource constraints and prioritization of frontend development, we have temporarily deferred backend and API integration. We believe this phased approach allows us to deliver a polished frontend experience before expanding our backend capabilities.
